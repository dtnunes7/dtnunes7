- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dtnunes7. I'm from Brazil, 35 years old and starting a career transition to data science and IT stuff.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science, business analysis, rock n roll, soccer and a good beer.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, SQL and Machine Learning. It's all in the early stages, but I'm confident that I'll get there.
